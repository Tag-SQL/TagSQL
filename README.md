# TagSQL

<strong>TagSQL = Tag code + SQL script</strong>, the key idea is append Tag code in SQL script comment, it similar to some template language solution, but more flexible and extendable;  A bit trick but big advantage  that make write SQL script phase to running mode smoothly, it is simply but efficientlyðŸš€.

# Motivation
TagSQL purpose is separate SQL script from Java code, never hardcode or embed SQL script in Java code, free code then free time,  enjoy!
